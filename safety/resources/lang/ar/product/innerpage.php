            in 2001. National Medical Products continuously refined the concept of jet injection, a technology 
            previously used by the military to deliver vaccines. By taking into consideration the depth of injection, 
            energy source, ease of use, and sterility, National Medical Products was able to create a self contained, 
            single use, sterile, subcutaneous jet injector we now know as the J-Tip needle free jet injection.</p>
            <p>The team behind National Medical Products and the J-Tip include individuals with decades of experience in 
            medical device development, injection molding, automation, and packaging. Many team members have been with 
            the company since day one and are experts in the field of jet injection. The J-Tip has a U.S. FDA 510(k) 
            marketing clearance and is 100% made in the U.S.A.</p>',

            <p>
            In 2015 ENA Clinical Practice Guideline Committee gave us their highest level of recommendation (Level A) 
            to Subdermal Local Anesthetic with Needle-Free Delivery (using the J-Tip).

            In 2008 a study was completed by Kosair Children’s hospital to compare ELA-Max to J-Tip prior to IV’s in 
            pediatric patients. This was their finding: “J-Tip jet injection of 1% buffered lidocaine provided greater 
            anesthesia than a 30-minute application of ELA-Max according to patient self-assessment of pain for 
            children aged 8 to 15 years undergoing PIV catheter insertion.” *Study information available on request.
