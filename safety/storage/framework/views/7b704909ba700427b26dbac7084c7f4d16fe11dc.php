					What is an appraisal?
				</label>
				<div class="answers">
					<p>Since 2012 GMC has made it mandatory for the licensed doctors to undergo the process of revalidation. For GMC revalidation, annual appraisal for doctors is essential.</p>

					<p>Based on annual appraisal reports and supporting information, the GMC revalidates doctors and enables them to maintain their license. Medical appraisal is not only an evaluation of the medical practice of doctors, but it also provides an opportunity for the doctors to determine their professional development goals and evaluate their personal professional development needs.</p>

					<p>Appraisals for doctors is a procedure that involves a complete self-review in coordination with the appraiser which is supported by the evidence which is gathered from the complete scope of work by the doctor.</p>

					<p>Medical appraisal is not only designed to scrutinize the doctors, but it has definite and far reaching purposes. These include;</p>

					<ul class="faq-ul">
						<li>To give an opportunity to doctor to reflect and evaluate his/ her practise and performance in collaboration with their appraiser for demonstrating that they are always keep themselves up-to-date and are fit to practise.</li>
						<li>To enable and assist the doctors in planning and determining their professional developmental goals.</li>
						<li>To identify their needs of learning</li>
						<li>To make sure that the doctors are efficiently working in alignment to their organisational precedence.</li>
						<li>Without appraisal process in place it is difficult to evaluate and monitor the doctor’s fitness to practice and monitor their personal objectives of development.</li>

					What is a Designated Body? </label>
				<div class="answers">
					<p>Your designated body is the organisation that is responsible for providing you with your appraisal and helping you with revalidation. Being connected with a designated body means you can be confident not only of support throughout the appraisal and revalidation processes, but also that you are working within an organisation that is committed to monitoring and improving the quality of it services and therefore, ultimately, patient care..</p>

					What is a Responsible Officer (RO)? </label>
				<div class="answers">
					<p>The responsible officer (RO) of the designated body is the person who makes a recommendation about you, usually every five years, to the General Medical Council (GMC) that you are up to date, fit to practise and should be revalidated. The responsible officer makes their recommendation to the GMC based upon your participation in appraisals throughout the five years, and the information that this provides the RO with about how you practise.</p>

					What are my options if I don’t have a designated body?</label>
				<div class="answers">
					<p>If a doctor does not have a designated body the GMC allows for submission of an annual return to the GMC directly. The appraiser will need to fill a form called the REV 12 form which needs to be submitted. In recent times the GMC has made the rules very stringent and most of the evidence for the appraisal needs to come from the UK. The GMC will also ask the doctor to sit a revalidation assessment exam in Manchester in the 5th year of their revalidation cycle.</p>

					<p>There is need to express an intention to work in the UK. The number of days required will need to be negotiated with the designated body. Once the DB link is established further documentation will be required to establish a formal connection with the DB but from an appraisal and revalidation perspective this will go on in the background and the doctor will be able to establish a link to a designated body.</p>
